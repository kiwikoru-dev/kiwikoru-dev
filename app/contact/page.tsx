 * /contact — real contact details, then the closing call-to-action.
 *
 * The details in <ContactCard/> are KiwiKoru's own, from the WordPress page body
 * (an earlier pass of this project wrongly concluded they had none, because the
 * `admin_email` option is the untouched Bitnami default — see contact-card.tsx).
 *
 * Still outstanding: the CTA buttons in <FinalCta/> are unwired real <button>s.
 * "book a 15-min cloud review" needs a Cal.com booking link behind it — see
 * CLAUDE.md's Stripe / Cal.com note for where that integration belongs.
