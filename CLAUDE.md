# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

@AGENTS.md

> The directive above is load-bearing: this is **Next.js 16** (App Router, Turbopack) with breaking changes from older versions. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` before writing Next-specific code.

## Working conventions

- **Commits & PRs: no AI/Claude attribution.** Do not add `Co-Authored-By: Claude…`, "Generated with Claude Code", or any mention of AI tooling to commit messages or PR descriptions. Write them as a normal human author would.
- **The dev server is the user's to run.** Do not launch or stop a dev server yourself, and don't kill `next` processes or `rm -rf .next` on your own. Ask the user to start/stop/restart it. To verify a change works, ask them to run it (or to share output), rather than spinning up your own instance.
- **Plan mode is discussion mode until told otherwise.** When the user enters plan mode, treat it as a discussion: explore, explain, sketch (ASCII/diagrams), and clarify — but do **not** write or finalize a plan, and do **not** call `ExitPlanMode`, until the user explicitly says to (e.g. "make the plan"). Keep iterating on understanding until then.
- **Feature first, degrade later.** When building a new visual/interactive feature, implement exactly what was asked and make it work fully on capable desktop browsers (Chrome AND Firefox) **first** — do not wire in quality-tier gating, reduced-motion branches, or device fallbacks in the first pass. Add degradation only after the user has approved the working feature. In particular, a mid-session quality step-down (frame watchdog) must never swap out or freeze a feature the user is looking at — tier decisions for mounted features are locked at mount.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Turbopack dev server on http://localhost:3000
npm run build    # production build
npm run start    # serve the production build
npm run lint     # eslint (next/core-web-vitals + next/typescript)
```

There is **no test runner configured** — no Jest/Vitest/Playwright, no test files. Don't invent test commands; verification is `lint` + `build` + manual browser check.

**Only one `next dev` may run per project dir** (Next 16 enforces this). A second instance exits, and concurrent servers sharing `.next/` can corrupt the cache → `SyntaxError: Unexpected end of JSON input` on startup. The recovery is to stop all `next` processes, `rm -rf .next`, and start one — but per the working conventions above, **ask the user to do this**; don't start/stop servers or delete `.next/` yourself.

## What this is

A single-page marketing site for **KiwiKoru Limited**, an AWS consulting partner (migration + managed services). `app/page.tsx` composes the page sections (`<Hero/>`, `<Tagline/>`, …). UI lives in the root-level `components/` tree (see **Project structure** below). Layout is **Figma-driven** — components carry Figma node IDs in comments and use absolute pixel positioning mapped to a 1512×982 hero frame, so changes should be cross-referenced against the cited nodes.

### ⚠️ This design was built for a different brand

The entire layout, WebGL work and design system were built for "ascnd", a design-subscription product, and were **rebranded onto KiwiKoru's content** rather than designed for it. Two consequences that matter when you edit:

- **Figma node IDs still point at the ascnd file.** They remain the authority for *layout and geometry* (positions, sizes, radii), but **not** for copy — every visible string has been rewritten. Don't "restore" copy to match a Figma node.
- **Placeholder content is marked, and some of it is not shippable.** KiwiKoru's source site (a thin WordPress build — see `CONTENT-SOURCE.md`) had no testimonials, pricing, FAQ, portfolio or about content, so those sections carry authored stand-in copy. Every instance is flagged `PLACEHOLDER` in the source. The testimonials and the portfolio tiles are the ones to take seriously: fabricated client quotes and stand-in project imagery must not go to production. `grep -rn "PLACEHOLDER" components/` lists them.

Stack: Next 16 (App Router, Turbopack) · React 19.2 · Tailwind v4 (CSS-first, `@theme` in `globals.css` — no `tailwind.config.js`) · TypeScript · Three.js / R3F. Path alias `@/*` → repo root.

## Project structure

The chosen organization is **Approach A — colocated feature folders** (Next's documented "store project files outside `app`" strategy). `app/` is kept **purely for routing**; all non-routing code lives in a root-level `components/` tree, imported via the `@/*` alias. Cross-folder imports use `@/components/...`; same-folder imports stay relative.

```
app/                          # routing ONLY — keep this thin
  layout.tsx                  # root: <LenisProvider> → sky + <Navbar> + page
  page.tsx                    # home: the full 14-section scroll
  services/  about/  reviews/  why-us/  contact/   # one page.tsx each
  globals.css  favicon.ico
  fonts/                      # self-hosted Product Sans (next/font/local)
  lab/glass/                  # the glass R3F sandbox route (scene colocated)
components/
  background/                 # fixed sky: background, cloud-layer, cloud-canvas
  providers/                  # lenis-provider, route-transition, theme, quality
  ui/                         # shared chrome/primitives: navbar, wordmark, icons, brand-mark
  sections/                   # one folder per page section, self-contained
    hero/                     # hero, hero-text, hero-reveal, grass-rocks, rock*, …
    intro/                    # intro, intro-scene, intro-state (the shared reveal gate)
    logos/                    # logos, logos-marquee (client-logo marquee)
    design-shots/             # design-shots, design-shots-reveal
    tagline/                  # tagline
```

Conventions:
- **`app/` stays routing-only.** New routes go in `app/`; their UI is composed from `components/`. Don't add a flat `app/components/` dump back.
- **Sections are self-contained**, but cross-section imports are allowed in this approach (e.g. `hero/hero.tsx` is the page composer — it pulls in `ui/navbar`, `sections/logos`, `sections/intro`, etc.).
- **`sections/intro/intro-state.ts` is the shared animation gate.** It's imported by `intro`, `hero-reveal`, `rock-reveal`, and `design-shots-reveal` to keep the intro→hero cascade in sync — treat its path/contract as load-bearing.
- **Future Stripe / Cal.com (Next 16 idiom):** UI-triggered mutations are **Server Actions** colocated with their feature (e.g. `components/sections/pricing/checkout.action.ts` with `"use server"`); webhooks/external callbacks are **Route Handlers** under `app/api/**/route.ts`. Shared clients/env go in a root `lib/` (e.g. `lib/stripe/`, `lib/cal/`, `lib/env.ts`). Don't create a generic `server/` dumping ground.
- Promote to **Feature-Sliced Design** (layered `widgets/features/entities/shared` with enforced import direction) only if the product grows past ~20 features; Approach A's folders map cleanly onto it.

## Architecture — the layered rendering model

The non-obvious structure is how the **fixed sky** sits behind **scrolling content**, all driven by one scroll source. Read these together:

- **`app/layout.tsx`** mounts, at the root: `<LenisProvider>` wrapping two independent fixed layers — `<Background/>` (sky) and `<CloudLayer/>` (clouds) — plus page content.
- **`LenisProvider`** (`lenis-provider.tsx`) — the single global smooth-scroll instance. It hands its rAF to GSAP's ticker (`autoRaf: false`, `gsap.ticker.add(...)`, `lagSmoothing(0)`) and feeds `ScrollTrigger.update` on scroll. **One loop, no competing schedulers.** Everything scroll-driven (cloud parallax, future rock parallax) reads from this.
- **`Background`** (`background.tsx`) — a `fixed inset-0 -z-20` sky: solid `#62abff` fill → grain overlay (`public/textures/grain.png`). Sky **only**; the clouds are a separate layer. Mounted once globally; content scrolls over it.
- **`CloudLayer`** (`cloud-layer.tsx`) — its **own** `fixed inset-0 -z-10` layer (a *sibling* of `Background`, not nested inside it), so the sky and clouds z-stack independently. It device-gates, then mounts `CloudCanvas` (see below).
- **`Hero`** and its children stack *above* both fixed layers as transparent absolutely-positioned layers.

### ⚠️ Multi-route: what the single-page design assumed

The site is **six routes** (`/`, `/services`, `/about`, `/reviews`, `/why-us`, `/contact`), but the design was built as one page. Home is the full scroll; the other five re-present their sections standalone over the same shared sky. Three consequences, all already handled — don't undo them:

- **`<Intro>` / `<IntroLoader>` are home-only.** `introWillPlay()` (`intro-state.ts`) additionally requires `[data-hero]` in the DOM, which only `/` renders. Without that check, a hard load of any inner route answers `true` and the four consumers that gate on it — `cloud-layer`, `cloud-canvas`, `cursor-visual`, `quality-controller` — wait forever for intro events that never fire. **The visible symptom is the clouds never appearing**; treat them as the canary.
- **`<Navbar>` lives in `app/layout.tsx`, not in `<Hero>`.** It carries the `data-reveal-*` hooks **only on `/`**: `layout.tsx` stamps `reveal-armed` on `<html>`, `globals.css` hides `[data-reveal-soft]`, and only `<HeroReveal>` animates it back — so on any other route those hooks would leave the nav permanently at `opacity: 0`.
- **`<RouteTransition>`** (`components/providers/route-transition.tsx`) handles what a client navigation silently skips: resetting Lenis' scroll, refreshing ScrollTrigger against the new layout, and clearing the module-scoped intro memo.

Any section that **pins** needs its `<div className="shrink-0">` wrapper reproduced on every route that uses it (`<body>` is a flex column — see `app/page.tsx` and `app/why-us/page.tsx`).

### ⚠️ The constraint that governs this whole layout

**No `filter` / `backdrop-filter` may appear on an *ancestor* of the fixed `Background` or `CloudLayer`** — a blurred ancestor breaks `position: fixed` descendants. This is why both are mounted at the root, not nested. The navbar/CTA `backdrop-blur` is fine because those are *siblings*, not ancestors. Cloud softness must come from the sprite's alpha, never a CSS blur on a parent. (Full rationale: `docs/cloud-rendering-research.md` §4 / §9.)

### ⚠️ The heavy-effect contract (applies to vendored imports too)

Any **heavy effect** — a WebGL canvas, a free-running animation loop, a per-frame SVG/CSS filter — must satisfy ALL of these before it ships, **including third-party/vendored components** (React Bits, codepen ports, etc.). Two vendored drops (`splash-cursor.tsx`, `glass-surface.tsx`) each violated several of these and became the page's dominant GPU cost (see `docs/webgl-animation-audit-2026-07-02.md` F1/F2/F7):

1. **Rides the shared GSAP ticker** — no private `requestAnimationFrame` loop (LenisProvider's "one loop, no competing schedulers" mandate). Demand-mode R3F canvases (`frameloop="demand"` + `invalidate()`) also qualify.
2. **Idles to zero** — when nothing visibly changes (pointer still, effect faded, section off-screen), it must stop repainting entirely. "Renders an unchanged frame at 120 fps" is the failure mode this exists to prevent.
3. **Reads the quality tier** — its GPU-cost knobs (resolution, dpr, iterations, segments) come from `lib/perf/tiers.ts`, added to the consumer registry there **in the same PR** that introduces the effect. Repaint rates go through `heavyEffectFpsCap()` / `makeCappedInvalidate`.
4. **SSR-stable first render** — no browser sniffing (`CSS.supports`, `navigator.*`) in the render path; render a stable fallback and switch branches only after mount (`useSyncExternalStore` or a mounted flag), or hydration mismatches result.
5. **dpr ≤ 1.5** — never raw `devicePixelRatio` (deliberate site-wide cap; the soft/blurred nature of every effect here hides it).

A vendored file that can't satisfy these as-is gets **forked deliberately** (short header documenting the deltas) — "don't hand-edit vendored code" loses to the architecture contract.

### Volumetric clouds (R3F)

`docs/cloud-rendering-research.md` is the **authoritative architecture decision record** for the sky — read §9 before touching clouds. **Cloud colour & lighting** (why white clouds rendered grey, the ACES `NoToneMapping` fix, and the key-light-vs-flat-ambient decision) is documented in `docs/cloud-color-and-lighting.md` — read it before touching the lights or material in `cloud-canvas.tsx`. The chosen path is `@react-three/drei` `<Clouds>`/`<Cloud>` with a strict optimization mandate:

- `CloudLayer` (`cloud-layer.tsx`) gates whether the canvas mounts at all: skipped on no-WebGL, `prefers-reduced-motion`, and `≤768px` screens, via `useSyncExternalStore` (server snapshot is `false`, so SSR renders the cheap fallback and re-evaluates after hydration — no mismatch). A baked static-image fallback for ineligible devices is a documented TODO.
- `CloudCanvas` (`cloud-canvas.tsx`) is loaded via `next/dynamic({ ssr: false })` (required — `ssr:false` can't live in a Server Component). It uses a single batched `<Clouds>` draw call, a **self-hosted** texture (`public/textures/cloud-puff.png` — a *local copy of drei's detailed cloud sprite*, so the CDN is never hit at runtime), `alpha:true` (clouds only; color/grain stay DOM), `antialias:true`, `dpr` up to 2 (crisp on retina), and handles WebGL context loss/restore. **The sprite must be a detailed painted puff** — the legacy `cloud.png` was a featureless radial blob, which made the cloud render as a washed-out blur with no form.
- Rendering is `frameloop="demand"` (per doc §9): no free-running rAF. Clouds have `speed=0` (static), so frames are painted only on change. `ParallaxRig` maps `ScrollTrigger` progress → each cloud group's `y` then `invalidate()`s; `InvalidateOnReady` pumps a short burst after mount (drei builds geometry/loads the texture over several frames, so one mount frame can paint blank) and repaints on tab re-show.
- **Context-loss resilience:** rely on `THREE.WebGLRenderer`'s built-in `webglcontextlost`/`restored` handling — do **not** add a manual `preventDefault()` handler (anti-pattern; leaks across Fast Refresh and was the cause of the clouds vanishing). `ContextWatchdog` only repaints on restore and, if a real driver reset never restores within ~3s, remounts the `<Canvas>` via a `key` bump. `frustumCulled={false}` on `<Clouds>` stops the InstancedMesh (stale bounding sphere under parallax) from being culled.

## Fonts

**Product Sans is the global default font.** Wiring spans two files:

- `layout.tsx` loads fonts via `next/font`: Product Sans self-hosted with `next/font/local` from `app/fonts/*.ttf` (→ `--font-product-sans`), Instrument Serif and Geist Mono from `next/font/google`. Each font's `.variable` class is applied to `<html>`.
- `globals.css` (`@theme inline`) maps those to tokens: `--font-sans` and the `--font-product` alias both resolve to Product Sans; `body` uses `var(--font-sans)`, so everything inherits Product Sans without an explicit class. `font-instrument` → Instrument Serif (the italic-feel hero accent); `font-mono` → Geist Mono.

Note: Product Sans is Google's proprietary corporate typeface — a licensing consideration, flagged in the source comments.

### ⚠️ `public/fonts/product-sans-medium.v3.typeface.json` is a SUBSET, and it is VERSIONED

That file feeds every `<Text3D>` on the site — the glass wordmark (intro, footer, `/lab/glass`) **and** the five page headings (`glass-heading-scene.tsx`). It is **not a full face**: it carries only the glyphs those strings need — currently the 17-glyph union `a b c e h i k n o r s t u v w y` + space (~7.6 KB), covering `kiwikoru` · `services` · `about` · `reviews` · `why us` · `contact`.

Any character not in it renders as **nothing**, silently — no console error. Adding a heading with a new letter (a `d`, an `l`, a `g`…) means regenerating.

**The `.vN` in the filename is load-bearing.** `next.config.ts` serves it `immutable`, and the generic `/fonts/:path*` rule is `stale-while-revalidate=31536000` — so reusing a filename after changing the glyph set serves returning visitors the OLD subset for up to a day. That is not theoretical: it was caught live here, where the new "services" heading rendered as **"ri"** — the only two of its letters present in the previous 7-glyph subset. **Bump the version, and update the five consumers plus the `next.config.ts` rule together.**

The regeneration recipe (tooling is not vendored; run it in a scratch dir):

1. `pip install fonttools brotli` — then decompress the source face, which is woff2 and unreadable by opentype.js:
   `f = TTFont("app/fonts/ProductSans-Medium.woff2"); f.flavor = None; f.save("out.ttf")`
2. `npm i opentype.js` — walk `glyph.getPath(0, 0, unitsPerEm)` for each needed char and emit the facetype schema `{ha, x_min, x_max, o}`. Two traps: opentype's Y is screen-down but the typeface format is Y-up, so **negate every y**; and three.js `FontLoader` reads `q`/`b` with the **end point first**, then the control point(s) — not the usual order.
3. Carry `familyName` / `ascender` / `descender` / `resolution` / `boundingBox` over from the existing file unchanged (same source font, and `FontLoader` derives line height from `boundingBox`). Regenerate `glyphs` only.
4. **Verify before shipping**: regenerate the *old* glyph set first and diff `ha`/`x_min`/`x_max` against the current file — they must match exactly — then build a real `TextGeometry` for old and new and compare bounding boxes. This catches a bad path conversion, which otherwise only shows up as subtly deformed letters in the browser.

Then retune `WIDTH_PER_SIZE` in `intro.tsx` and `footer-glass-scene.tsx` — see the comment at its definition for how that constant relates to the measured geometry width. (Adding glyphs alone does not change it: the existing glyph paths are untouched, so "kiwikoru" still measures 3.8580 × size after the v2 expansion.)

`glass-heading-scene.tsx` needs no such constant — it derives its glyph size from the R3F viewport, because the headings vary in length and `fov` is vertical (see the comments there).

## Config notes

- `next.config.ts` pins `turbopack.root` to `__dirname` so Next doesn't infer the workspace root from a stray lockfile higher up the tree.
- `reactStrictMode: false` is **intentional** — Strict Mode's dev-only double-mount creates/destroys the WebGL cloud context within ~100ms, making the clouds flicker on load. Production never runs Strict Mode, so this makes dev match prod. Don't re-enable globally; wrap non-WebGL subtrees in `<React.StrictMode>` if you want the dev checks back.
- Public assets: `public/rocks/` (hero cliff cutouts), `public/shots/` (design-collage images), `public/textures/` (`cloud-puff.png` — the detailed cloud sprite in use; `cloud.png` — legacy soft-blob sprite, unused; `grain.png`).
