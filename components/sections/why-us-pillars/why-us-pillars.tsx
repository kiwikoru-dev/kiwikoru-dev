/**
 * KiwiKoru's three "Why Choose Us" pillars — the substance of `/why-us`.
 *
 * ✅ REAL CONTENT. These are KiwiKoru's own three pillars and their own
 * descriptions, from the WordPress front page (wp_posts ID 23, "Why Choose Us"),
 * rewritten into the site's lowercase voice. The claims are theirs — "certified
 * experts", "enterprise-grade", "24/7" — so don't embellish them.
 *
 * The same three words drive the pinned reel further down the page
 * (why-stay-data.ts PHRASES); this block is where they're actually explained.
 *
 * Transparent over the shared fixed sky, flow-sized. No Figma node — the ascnd
 * design had no slot for this copy.
