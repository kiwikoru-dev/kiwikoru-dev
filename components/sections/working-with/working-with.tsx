/**
 * "who you're working with" — Figma frame node 423:412 (1512×982).
 *
 * A quiet, full-viewport statement section: a mixed-font headline over a
 * two-tone paragraph, centred in the frame. Like the tagline and pills, it
 * renders at DESIGN SCALE (fixed px, centre-anchored) and stays TRANSPARENT
 * over the shared sky — the Figma mockup paints its own #62abff fill, grain and
 * two soft cloud overlays, but in this app the sky is the global fixed
 * <Background/> (fill → grain → volumetric clouds) mounted in layout.tsx, so
 * scrolling into here stays in one continuous world (no double grain, no baked
 * cloud PNGs fighting the live R3F cloud field).
 *
 * Layout (Figma frame 423:464, 726×214 at frame centre): a centred column,
 * `gap-48px`, text-centre —
 *   • Headline (423:465, 49px / −1.47px tracking / 1.1 leading): "who you're "
 *     and " with" in Product Sans Light (font-light), "working" in Instrument
 *     Serif (font-instrument) — the same italic-feel accent the hero uses.
 *   • Paragraph (423:466, 25px / 1.1 leading, Product Sans Regular): the first
 *     sentence is full white; the remainder drops to white/60, exactly as the
 *     design fades the supporting copy.
 *
 * The scroll reveal (see working-with-reveal.tsx) drives the [data-ww-*] nodes
 * below; the markup renders FINISHED (SSR / no-JS / reduced-motion show the full
 * statement), the driver only hides + plays once it knows it'll animate. The
 * headline is authored as explicit per-word spans (not SplitText) so the serif
 * "working" can carry its own data-hook and get a distinct beat.
