/**
 * "AimatedCards" section — Figma frame 220:1418 (1512×982). A centered row of
 * three glass cards (subscribe · request · receive) over the shared sky. Like
 * the hero, it renders at design scale (fixed px, center-anchored) and stays
 * transparent so the fixed <Background/> + clouds show through.
 *
 * Each card's media is a self-contained component so the auto-running infinite
 * animations (cursor drift, request conveyor, shot-grid scroll) can be layered
 * on next without touching the layout.

        THREE regimes, because a card's media guts are rigidly px-tuned against
        live GSAP and cannot be made fluid (the why-stay "scale, don't rebuild"
        call):

        ≥ wide (1408) — the design: one centred absolute row, 3×440 + 2×20 gaps.
        768 → wide    — the row goes static and WRAPS. The cards keep their exact
                        440px width, so nothing inside them is touched or scaled;
                        they simply re-arrange 3-up → 2-up → 1-up as the viewport
                        narrows. This is real reflow, not shrinking, which is why
                        the media stays legible on an iPad.
        < 768         — the phone stack: one column, each card scaled to fit as a
                        unit (globals.css "Card stack scale"). Below ~488px a
                        440px card no longer fits any other way.

        Each card sits in a [data-card-scale] wrapper: a plain shrink-0 flex item
        until the phone stack, where it becomes the scale carrier. Scale rides the
        WRAPPER, not [data-card-shell], so the article's transform stays free for
        the reveal.
