/**
 * "comparisonSection" — Figma frame 420:412 (1512×982).
 *
 * A mixed-font heading + supporting line (node 469:550, frame-centred at top:85)
 * above a glass card (node 469:553, frame-centred at top:296) holding a 6×5
 * feature matrix (kiwikoru vs. in-house / consultancy / freelance devops / managed hosting). The
 * two are 211px apart (85→296) and the pair sits centred in the frame; we
 * reproduce that as one viewport-centred 812×1360 block. Like the other sections
 * it renders at DESIGN SCALE (fixed px, centre-anchored) and stays TRANSPARENT
 * over the shared sky — the fixed <Background/> (fill → grain → clouds) shows
 * through, so the Figma mockup's own #62abff fill + grain are intentionally NOT
 * reproduced here.
 *
 * The matrix is a CSS grid whose column/row tracks are the exact Figma pixel
 * gaps, so the row hairlines land where the design draws them (as cell top
 * borders). The column dividers are separate overlay lines because the design
 * insets them 13.5px from the top edge (Figma Line223), which a cell border
 * can't do. The featured "kiwikoru" column gets a highlighted panel behind the
 * grid (node 469:554) whose edges serve as its own two dividers. Card glass
 * matches the house convention
 * (see cards/card-shell.tsx): 1.5px white/30 edge, black 10→5 gradient, and
 * the white inset veil in place of backdrop-blur (frost-swept 2026-07-18 —
 * this panel was the page's single largest frost, 1360×601 re-rastered per
 * scrolled frame over a sky-only backdrop; docs/backdrop-filter-sweep.md).

            listing all five options with kiwikoru featured on top. The desktop card

            stays legible down to about there, but at iPad-portrait width the six
            columns squeeze the text to unreadable ribbons. This stack — already
