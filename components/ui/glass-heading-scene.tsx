/**
 * The page-heading liquid glass — the same refractive Text3D treatment as the
 * welcome wordmark, in a smoked charcoal tint, used as the <h1> for the five nav
 * pages (see page-header.tsx, which owns the layout and the fallback).
 *
 * Adapted from footer-glass-scene.tsx, minus everything that scene needs and
 * this one doesn't (mountains, the per-letter ridgeline occluder, the scroll
 * reveal rig). What's kept is the part that matters: a REQUEST-DRIVEN canvas.
 *
 * ── Why this is affordable ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * MeshTransmissionMaterial renders the scene to an offscreen buffer to refract
 * it — twice with `backside` on. That is the single most expensive effect in
 * this codebase, and here it sits on FIVE routes permanently. It only works
 * because the heading is STATIC: `frameloop="never"` means nothing paints unless
 * we ask, and the only things that change what the glass should look like are
 * the sky mode and a resize. So it paints a short burst at mount, a burst on
 * mode change, a burst on resize — and otherwise costs exactly zero.
 *
 * That is the "idles to zero" clause of the heavy-effect contract (CLAUDE.md).
 * If you ever add motion here (a hover tilt, a drift), it stops being free and
 * has to justify itself against that contract properly.
 *
 * Quality knobs come from lib/perf/tiers.ts and are SNAPSHOTTED AT MOUNT — the
 * working conventions require that a mid-session tier step-down never swaps out
 * a feature the user is looking at.

// ── Sizing: ONE glyph size for all five headings ────────────────────────────

// Driven by the viewport WIDTH and the WORST-CASE width-per-size — deliberately
// not per-word. Width-per-size is a property of the string (measured through the
// real TextGeometry: "about" 2.81 · "why us" 3.31 · "reviews" 3.62 · "contact"
// 3.64 · "services" 3.90), so fitting each word to the same width would render
// every page at a DIFFERENT letter size — "about" would tower over "services".
// Sizing off the widest instead gives identical letterforms on every page, with
// the words simply ending up different widths. That is the choice the design
// asked for.
//
// `fov` is vertical, so the height clamp below is the secondary guard: it stops
// a short stage from letting the glyph overflow vertically.

 * The intro wordmark's glass, in sky blue.
 *
 * ⚠️ These are the WELCOME GLASS's exact values (see the <Text3D> block in
 * intro-scene.tsx) — ior 1.28, roughness 0.31, chromaticAberration 0.65,
 * clearcoat 0, temporalDistortion 0.28, and the absolute lengths thickness 0.3 /
 * bevelThickness 0.175 / bevelSize 0.095 / letterSpacing +0.02. The brief was
 * "same font, same design" as the intro, so this must stay in lockstep with it.
 * An earlier pass had its own tuning (ior 1.42, clearcoat 1, size-proportional
 * lengths) and read as a visibly different material.
 *
 * The absolute lengths work here because the sizing above lands the glyph at
 * ~3.3 world units — inside the intro's own ~4–5 range. If the stage geometry
 * ever changes enough to move that materially, these need revisiting rather than
 * silently drifting.
 *
 * ── The tint ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Colour in MeshTransmissionMaterial is Beer–Lambert ABSORPTION, not a fill:
 * light is tinted by `attenuationColor` in proportion to how far it travels
 * through the solid, over `attenuationDistance`. Turning `color` down does not
 * tint it — it just dulls the highlights.
 *
 * Sky blue = the intro's LONG distance (4) with a blue attenuation colour
 * instead of the intro's near-white #eaf4ff. Long distance keeps it translucent
 * so the refraction and chromatic edges survive; the hue simply reads a shade
 * deeper than the sky behind it. Swap ATTENUATION_COLOR alone to recolour.
