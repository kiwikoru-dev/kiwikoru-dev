/**
 * KiwiKoru brand mark — a cloud with a kiwi in negative space.
 *
 * Replaces the inherited double-chevron (`logo.tsx`, deleted), and is rendered
 * in `currentColor` exactly like the chevron was: flat white in the intro loader
 * and in the nav pill. The source artwork is orange, but the mark is used
 * monochrome throughout — do NOT reintroduce the gradient here; a coloured mark
 * would break the loader's white-on-sky look and the glass pill's monochrome
 * chrome.
 *
 * ── Provenance ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Traced from the only supplied artwork:
 *   website-A/…/uploads/2025/12/Gemini_Generated_Image_ornffrornffrornf-removebg-preview.png
 * a 500×500 AI-generated (Gemini) PNG. That file also contains a "KiwiKoru"
 * wordmark band and Gemini's watermark sparkle in the bottom-right; the trace is
 * cropped to the mark alone (source box 108,90–392,290) so NEITHER is included.
 *
 * The kiwi is a TRANSPARENT CUTOUT in the source, not white pixels, so the alpha
 * channel alone carries the whole design — hence a single-colour path works. The
 * kiwi's beak runs out to the cloud's lower-left edge, which splits the cloud
 * into two disjoint lobes; with the eye that makes three subpaths, none nested.
 * `fill-rule="evenodd"` is therefore belt-and-braces rather than load-bearing.
 *
 * Trace verified against the source alpha at 99.72% pixel agreement / 99.56%
 * IoU, with the kiwi cutout confirmed present (a filled-in kiwi is the failure
 * mode to watch for if this is ever re-traced).
 *
 * ⚠️ This is raster art traced to vector, not an authored logo. If KiwiKoru
 * supplies a real vector mark, replace the path below — nothing else in this
 * file is specific to the artwork.
 *
 * viewBox is offset by 1 because the bitmap was padded before tracing: a shape
 * flush to the bitmap edge makes potrace emit a canvas-sized outer contour,
 * which inverts the mark under evenodd. The offset removes the pad again, so the
 * artwork sits flush in user units and the 284×200 (1.42:1) box is exact.
 *
 * Uses `currentColor`, so colour follows the surrounding text colour. Callers
 * must size it on ONE axis (`w-*`) — it is not square, so `size-*` letterboxes.
