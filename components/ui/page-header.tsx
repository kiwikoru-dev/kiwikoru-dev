/**
 * Page heading for the inner routes — the page name as refractive smoked-glass
 * letterforms (the same Text3D + MeshTransmissionMaterial treatment as the
 * welcome wordmark), with a supporting line beneath. Used by all five nav pages
 * so they read as one set; the home page has no header, since the hero is its
 * identity.
 *
 * ── Two renderings of the same heading ──────────────────────────────────────
 * Eligible sessions (WebGL, real motion, > 768px) get the glass. Everything else
 * — phones, reduced-motion, no-WebGL — keeps the flat glass PILL, which is what
 * this component used to be. That split follows cloud-layer.tsx: a transmission
 * material renders the scene to an offscreen buffer (twice, with backside on),
 * which is not a cost worth paying on a phone GPU for a static heading.
 *
 * The gate is a useSyncExternalStore whose SERVER snapshot is `false`, so the
 * HTML always ships the pill and the glass swaps in after hydration — no
 * mismatch, and it re-evaluates live when the breakpoint or motion pref changes.
 *
 * ⚠️ ACCESSIBILITY: the <h1> text stays in the DOM in BOTH renderings. When the
 * glass is showing, the heading is `sr-only` and the canvas is aria-hidden — a
 * canvas of pixels is not a heading, and this is the page's only h1, so losing
 * it would cost the route its document outline in search and screen readers.
 *
 * ⚠️ NO `data-reveal-*` hooks anywhere here. Those are hidden globally by
 * `.reveal-armed` (globals.css) and only <HeroReveal> un-hides them — and that
 * runs on `/` alone, so any such hook would leave this header invisible on every
 * page that uses it. Markup renders FINISHED; <RevealOnScroll> adds the entrance
 * once it knows it will animate.

 * moment. That is a layout shift (bad on its own), but worse here: ScrollTrigger
 * has already measured the page, and `/why-us` PINS a section whose scroll range
 * is derived from those measurements. Moving the content under a live pin is how
 * you get a scroll that behaves oddly around the pinned section.
 *
 * Keep these in lockstep if you resize the heading.
